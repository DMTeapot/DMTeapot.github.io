    <h3>n,n-DMT</h3>
    <h4>Experiences</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Session
        <ul>
          <li>28mg, vaporized- first stronger trip.
            <p>Disorientated and quite apprehensive, first real tryptamine experience. Room filled with entities, though none were visible. I’d never had entities before so I watched with some concern and trepidation from my bed. I was listening to Becoming Insane, which likely influenced it. The corner of my room was full of dancing pixielike entities, moving manically, eternally energetic. I became uncomfortable with their manic movement, they seemed mischevious and potentially bitey. I directed my attention elsewhere, to the tapestry, on which the stars were dancing and moving about, colors much brighter. The popcorn ceiling was a… coral-like amalgamation of beings that was looking at me with a mixture of concern and interest. The light through my window was too bright to really see anything out of. The curtains were calm and seductive, nurturing and feminine. As the effects began to wane and I closed my eyes, I also returned to a dream I had had as a child, in which I was small – about army-man sized – exploring a childhood room full of animate toys. Later, as I had come down significantly and was loading more whilst standing in the kitchen, a profound sense of having a tall, dark, shadowy entity curiously watching over my shoulder. Not at all unfriendly, just curious about how to use the vape.</p></li>
          <li>17mg, vaporized
            <p>much calmer, I’d turned off my music. Tapestry resumed its dancing, colors heightened. I closed my eyes and interfaced telepathically with an entity much like Fork, an imaginary friend nymph from elementary school that lived in a pecan tree. I didn’t see her or anything, just had a sort of conversation of meaning.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>sesh
        <ul>
          <li>37mg, vaporized
            <p>strong headspace, sense of entity as I came up, drawing me. Ended up in my room, but an altered version, much brighter. Flourescent, almost. The walls extended outwards in the 4-dimensional way. Main focus of the experience was my fan. She seemed so happy and nice. Not intelligent, it’s a fan, but she’s a happy fan. The form of it seemed utterly alien, altered, like ultra-postmodern sleek space-age tech. Didn’t really look different from my fan, literally, but was formally different. Cleaner and brighter. Also featured was my plant, to which I didn’t ascribe any personality but seemed brighter and fuller. Thicker leaves, like a succulent.</p></li>
          <li>20ishmg, vaporized
            <p>lighter headspace, less of a sense of coming up. Remained in myself, but had assorted marshy entities. Droopy, long forms like spanish moss or willows. Largely black, with green and blue. Stonery, weird, calm, but not at all unfriendly. Just… swamplike. As I lifted my vape, had a sense that an older one was doing it along with me. Felt like I’d joined their eternal chill sesh.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>17mg, vaporized
        <p>headrush come up, some distraction & feeling of it being performative as was with Mariah. The bamboo out of the window seemed flowy, not much of a headspace. Quite light experience, didn’t feel a need to seek out a more powerful one in the moment as I felt not entirely adjusted to having her there.</p></li>
      <li>50mg, vaporized
        <p>strong experience. Later in the day to the previous one, Mariah had left. Powerful rush up for ~45 seconds, followed by a large loss of physical presence. In a sort of different realm, single feminine entity. Flirty, enjoyed attention and showing off, somewhat… she didn’t like not being focused on. Playful. If she sensed distraction, approached it with a “pooh, you don’t want to play anymore”. Showed how she could morph and alter her appearance, which was… impossible to really describe. Self-transforming. She stepped back through herself, was lithe, often reclining suggestively, though not overtly sexual. I was on facetime with Frannie, and felt drawn to return to speaking with her, so I returned to somewhat of consensus reality and left the entity at ~+4min 30 seconds to tell Frannie I had to hang up. I got a sense that I don’t like having to focus on two things at once. Entity had left, so I enjoyed tryptamine visuals for a few more minutes until they faded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>10mg vaporized in GVG (may have been more due to residue)
        <p>Pretty strong experience. Spent the time looking at this sentient object that kept twisting through itself, shifting colors, making faces, reflecting my emotions back at me. I couldn't focus my mind's eye beyond it, but saw a large room. Child shaped entities began coming and sitting around me, visible to the sides of the object. By the end of the experience maybe 6 of them were sitting there. Couldn't make out their faces. Upon opening my eyes, pretty intense OEVs. Cat looked very furry, and Reece looked to have multiple eyes around his own.</p>

    <h3>4-AcO-DMT</h3>
    <h4>Experiences</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>15mg, orally
        <p>taken in CO after acclimating. Onset started at about +30min, mild nausea and sense of unease, followed by gradual increase in visual acuity. Nausea largely subsided by +1hr. Mild, tryptamine visuals. Trees looking bright and colorful, much easier to distinguish individuals and species. Snow gleaming with pink and green tones, skiing a load of fun. Very pro-social, talking basically non-stop. Had a wonderful time with family and Frannie. Messed up cooking rice. Good mild daytime dose, fully able to function, if a bit scattered and hyper-talkative. No stress or lack of control whatsoever.</p>
